Agents are intelligent Systems which works with the environment...

Types:

1. Human Agent
2. Robotic Agent
3. Software Agent

Aspects of measuring the accuracy of the agent:

e.g. Rationality


Problem Solving in AI:

Types of Problems:
a. Toy Problem (For ideal scenarios)
b. Real-World Problems (For real-world scenarios)

Steps:
1. Goal Formulation
2. Problem Formulation
3. Initial State
4. Actions
5. Transition Model
6. Goal Test
7. Path Cost

Methods:
a. Algorithms (Perfectly predicted outcome, proven to grant an optimal result) 
b. Heuristic (Unpredicted outcome, not necessory that it will give answer or most optimized answer)
c. Root cause analysis

After deciding the method we can opt for the problem formulation

Types of Problems:
1. Single State Problems
2. Multiple State Problems
3. Contignecy Problems
4. Exploration Problems
